# **Data Structure Tutorial**

Welcome to the Data Structures Tutorial. This is a great resource to find 

- **[Stack](/1-stack.md)**
- **[Linked Lists](/2-linked_lists.md)**
- **[Tree](/3-tree.md)**
  
Each module will contain descriptions and examples. At the end of each module, you will find a problem to solve on your own. You should only look at the solution after you have attempted to solve the problem first.
